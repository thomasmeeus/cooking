# sous-vide steak

* Get some nices steaks (type doesn't really matter for sous-vide cooking)
* Put them in the vacuum sealer. Most of the time I buy them like this, so I don't bother adding seasoning at this stage
* Put them in the sous-vide machine according to the settings in the table below
* When done: Cool in cold/ice water to stop the cooking process. Open the packaging. Keep the moisture on the side and dry the steak with paper towels.
* Give the steak a nice sear on the grill on in a regular pan with lots butter on very high temperature. About 30 seconds on each side is more than enough.

* Sprinkle salt and pepper over it -> enjoy !


## temperatures & duration

These are minimum durations. Cooking them a bit longer doesn't hurt since the temperature controls the level of doneness.
