# poached egg

* Take a fridge cold (!) medium sized egg and cook it for exactly 13 minutes at 75Â°C
* Take it out after the 13 minutes and let it cool down for 3 minutes on a towel
* Gently crack the top and peal away about half the shell.
* Let the egg slide out on a plate. Season with some pepper/salt & enjoy!
